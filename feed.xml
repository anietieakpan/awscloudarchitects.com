Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies play a crucial role in controlling access to educational platforms, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access, modify, or administer learning resources. This blog post explores the application of IAM policy management in education, presenting architecture, advanced concepts, and practical examples.</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-iam-policies-in-education">The Importance of IAM Policies in Education</h2>

<p>Educational institutions handle vast amounts of sensitive data, including student records, research materials, and collaborative platforms.
